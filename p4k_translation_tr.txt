1 What's the internet?
B Ö L Ü M   1
1 İnternet nedir?

The internet is a global network of devices. 
İnternet, cihazların evrensel ağıdır.

When you use the internet on your laptop, tablet or phone, it is a part of the network.
Siz diz üstü bilgisayarınızdan, tabletinizden veya cep telefonunuzdan interneti kullandığınız zaman, cihazınız da o ağın bir parçası olur.

One of the special features of the internet is that lots of different technologies can all be used in the same network. 
İnternetin en önemli özelliklerinden biri, birçok farklı teknolojinin aynı ağ içerisinde kullanılabilir olmasıdır. [??]

We can even use the same connection to download a video, play a game and chat with our friends at the same time.
Aynı bağlantıyı, aynı anda video indirmek, oyun oynamak ve hatta arkadaşlarımızla chat yapmak için kullanabiliriz.

The internet is global, it is fast and gives us a whole world of opportunities.  
İnternet evrensel ve hızlıdır. Bize bir fırsatlar diyarı sunar. 

The internet is an amazing and powerful invention. Before the internet spread widely, there was no easy way of connecting lots of people with each other. It was much more difficult to listen to music or watch a movie. Also, the internet is a great place to learn as most of the information and knowledge is shared online.
İnternet etkili ve harika bir buluş. İnternet yaygınlaşmadan önce, insanları birbirine bağlamanın kolay bir yöntemi yoktu. Müzik dinlemek veya bir film izlemek çok daha zordu. Aynı zamanda, birçok bilgi çevrimiçi olarak paylaşılmış olduğu için, internet öğrenmek için de harika bir yer!

Internet technology is a bit like a big hill covered with snow – we can use it for skiing, snowboarding or building a snowman. All we need is snow! 
İnternet teknolojisi bir bakıma karlarla kaplı bir tepeye benzer; istersek kayak yaparız, istersek kardan adam. Tüm ihtiyacımız olan kar!

In the online world, the hill is our internet connection and the snow is the language the network speaks – the “internet protocol”!
Çevrimiçi dünyada, tepe bizim internet bağlantımızdır. Kar ise ağın konuştuğu dildir, yani "internet protokolleri"!

Social networks and other online services look like they are for free – but we actually pay with the personal information that we put online. Information about what we write or read or watch is used by online companies.
Sosyal ağlar ve diğer servisler sanki bedavalarmış gibi görünürler, ama aslında biz ödemeyi çevrimiçi paylaştığımız kişisel bilgilerimizle yapıyoruz. Bizim ne yazdığımızın, ne okuduğumuzun veya ne izlediğimizin bilgisi çevrimiçi şirketler tarafından kullanılıyor.

How can we stay in control of the information we share online?
Çevrimiçi paylaştığımız bilgilerin kontrolünü nasıl elimizde tutarız?

You will find the answer to this question in this booklet.
Bu sorunun cevabını elinizdeki kitapçıkta bulacaksınız.


C H A P T E R 2
2 What is privacy?
B Ö L Ü M   2
2 Mahremiyet nedir?

If we have privacy, we have control.
But what does this mean? 
Eğer mahremiyete sahipsek, kontrole de sahibizdir.
Peki bu da ne demek oluyor?

Privacy is our right to decidewhat to share and with whom we share it.
Mahremiyet, neyi kiminle paylaşacağımıza karar verme hakkımızdır.

This means, for example, that you have the right to ask Google, Facebook and others what kind of information they have collected about you. You can also ask them to delete these data.
Bu, örneğin şu anlama geliyor: Google, Facebook ve diğerlerine, sizin hakkınızda hangi bilgileri topladığını sorma hakkınız vardır. Aynı zamanda onlardan bu bilgileri silmelerini de talep edebilirsiniz.

When we protect our privacy, we can feel more secure and safe, because there might be information that could hurt us if the wrong person knows about it.
Mahremiyetimizi koruduğumuz zaman, daha güvenli hissedebiliriz. Çünkü, yanlış kişilerin eline geçerse bize zarar verebilecek bazı bilgiler olabilir.

It might be information that we wish to share with some people, like our parents or teachers, but not with anyone else.
Bu, belirli kişiler ile (mesela ailemiz veya öğretmenimizle) paylaşmak isteyip, onlar haricinde kimse ile paylaşmak istemeyeceğimiz bir bilgi olabilir.

But we can also help others when we protect our privacy, because they might want to share something with us that should not be shared with anyone else.
Kendi mahremiyetimizi korurken, aynı zamanda başkalarına da yardım edebiliriz. Çünkü, başka kimse ile paylaşılmaması gereken bir şeyi bizimle paylaşmak istemiş olabilirler.

We all have something we don't want to share with others.
Her birimizin başkalarıyla paylaşmak istemediği bir şeyler var.

Taking care of our own privacy has a lot to do with taking care of our friends too, because it helps us to be free, safe and trustworthy. 
Kendi mahremiyetimizi korumak, arkadaşlarımızın mahremiyetlerini korumakla da çok ilgilidir. Çünkü, bu bizim özgür, güvenli ve güvenilir olmamızı sağlar.

Our parents, friends or anyone who uses the computer after us, can also sometimes see what we
searched for. This can happen if we forget to log out or simply when they look at the computer's history.
Ailemiz, arkadaşlarımız veya bilgisayarı bizden sonra kullanan herhangi biri bazen yaptığımız aramaları görebilir. Bu durum çıkış yapmayı unuttuğumuzda veya onlar arama geçmişini incelediklerinde gerçekleşebilir.

>>Did you know?
>>Biliyor muydunuz?

Only 20 years ago, most homes had only one phone line which only one person could use at a time. Hardly anyone had a mobile phone and not many people had e-mail.  
Sadece 20 yıl önce, çoğu evde aynı anda sadece bir kişinin kullanabileceği tek bir telefon hattı vardı. Birinin cep telefonu sahibi olma ihtimali düşüktü ve pek çok insanın e-posta adresi yoktu.

»QUEST1: THE INTERNET IS...
»İPUCU1: İnternet ...

[A]...a network of devices.
[K]...cihazlardan oluşan bir ağdır.
[B]...an efficient fishing tool for international waters.
[B]...uluslararası sular için etkili bir balık tutma aletidir.
[C]...a social network.

C H A P T E R   3
Protect yourself on social networks

It can be so much fun to use social networks. On social networks, we can chat with friends and family, share pictures, send private messages and post information publicly. 

In some countries, children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use some social networks account. If you want to use social networks, it is best to ask your family and teachers to be sure. 

>> YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Diaspora and many more are all social networks.

Do you have favourite ones? Why do you like them? 

Some social networks even store the messages that we don't send! Imagine that, when you write a message to your friend on Facebook and don't send the message, 
your friend will not know about the message. But Facebook stores it! 

Keep in mind that everything we do on a social network is recorded on the computers of the companies. That doesn't mean that they are going to do something bad with it – but you should know that this is happening.

» DID YOU KNOW?
The things we type into a search engine or write in a chat message to a friend are not completely deleted. Companies that provide the services we use (like YouTube, 
Facebook, Snapchat and so on) can record what we write, the websites  we visit and the things we search for online. 

» QUEST 2: PRIVACY IS  IMPORTANT BECAUSE...
[T]  ...it helps us to watch music videos.
[R] ...it helps us to be free and in control online.
[G] ...it helps us to share pictures with the entire world.

Top three tips and tricks

1. Not everyone has to know everything about us

Like in the offline world, it is better to be choose carefully what we want to share or not. Instinctively, we share some things with some people and not with others. 
The internet sometimes makes it difficult to make that choice. 

This is partly because it's not always clear what is private online and what isn't, and partly because the internet has different rules than the offline world. 

For example: Our friends will forgive a stupid comment we made when we were angry, and understand our behaviour because they know us. If someone else reads our comment online, they might not understand what we meant and might think we were being mean. 

2. Safety and privacy online isn't difficult

We don't have to be super nerds to keep ourselves safe online. We can use a tablet, phone or laptop our classmates can't access, a password no one else can guess, watch videos online without being tracked. We can do this in really simple ways.

3. Knowing what or who we're protecting ourselves against

Just as banks need to protect themselves from thieves, we also have to protect ourselves - against companies tracking us online, classmates that might be 
angry about something, or nosy parents being... nosy parents. 

We should ask ourselves what the real threats are and what we can do about them. Once we have thought about these threats, we'll find that it really is possible to keep ourselves safe and control our privacy.




C H A P T E R   5
Safer messaging

We all use our phones to send messages to friends and family. 

But some messaging apps read the contents of our messages and track who we talk to. Some apps do this so they can profit from this information.

» What you say and do online is very valuable for companies. 

The companies who make messaging apps often scan what we say. They track who we're talking to so they can show us advertisements to make us buy something or to share it with other companies. You can check out a list of cool messaging apps at the end of the booklet. These messaging apps also ensure that we don't receive texts from strangers. And there is also a guide how to install Signal in this booklet – Signal is a cool app to keep your messages safe.

» QUEST 3: SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE GREAT BECAUSE...
[Q]  ...I can be sure that they will never use or sell my data.
[M] ...I can stay in touch with friends and family.
[N] ...I can be sure that only my friends can see the photos I post there




C H A P T E R   6
Smartphone security

Our phones have become very important for using the internet.

We use them when we want to communicate with our friends and family, when we use social networks or just browse the web.

But our phones are also useful for many other things, we can use them as a torch, to play games or to check the time of the next bus.

When you install a new app, do you read what permission you are giving the app and how it can access information on your phone? Does a torch app really need
access to your address book?

It is very tempting to just skip past the »Accept« screen, but it is good to stop and think. There are good reasons not to trust an app that is asking for stuff that it obviously does not need.

With just a few clicks we can also check and even restrict the permissions of our phones or apps that are already installed. On most devices we can find those in the »Settings«. Have a browse around the settings of your phone, it is good to learn about how your phone works.

» Many apps get access to your personal stuff stored on your phone.

We can restrict access to our location, add a password to unlock our phone screen, we could also encrypt (protect) the whole phone with only a few clicks.

Making our phones more secure and privacy-friendly, doesn't take much time. Towards the end of this booklet, you can find a list of great apps for this.

» DID YOU KNOW?
If there is a good reason to give an app permission for something – a photo app, for example, that needs to have access to your camera – then there's little to worry about. But if you think that the app is asking for too much, you can check if there are other versions of the app in the store that ask for fewer permissions.

DIGITAL DEFENDERS v DATA INTRUDERS (II)

MIND FREER

TEAM: DIGITAL DEFENDERS
    
POWERS: He fights for your right to decide what to share and with whom. He has the ability to create a private and secure environment where you can say what you think.

WEAPONS: His mind.

MAN IN THE MIDDLE.

TEAM: DATA INTRUDERS

POWERS: He has mystical powers to intercept what you do online. He can pretend to be a legitimate person online and then use this to hack right into your communications, to read your messages, see your photos and watch your videos.

WEAPONS: His suit and antennas.




CHAPTER 7
Surfing the internet

A browser is often how we use the internet.

» It's easy to forget that the browser is a little piece of software itself.

It is sometimes the first thing you open when turning on your phone, tablet or computer, and the last thing you close. But a lot goes on inside the browser that you're not aware of and that be bad (or good) for your privacy.

When we go online to buy something, watch videos or to see what our friends have been posting recently, we leave digital footprints. Some websites and social networks use these footprints to follow us.

» Websites collect lots of stuff about us!

Who our friends are, what we like, what we are searching for and what we are listening to can all be tracked. These websites can do this because they use »cookies« in our browsers. These »cookies « are little pieces of software.

They are invisible to us but when enough of data is collected and combined with other information about us, personal details that we think are secret become known
to many people and companies.

Most devices come with a browser. On Windows we can use the Internet Explorer, Apple devices come with Safari, and Android devices' default browser is Google Chrome. But those are not necessarily the browsers that work best for you.

» DID YOU KNOW?
Make sure to check the »privacy options« of your browser and change the default settings so that you take control – just like Perfect Wave! Many people think that
the best browser for your privacy and security is Firefox! Why? Because you can customise it, control it, and see how it works. It is possible that it is not installed on
your computer, but you can download it very easily.

DIGITAL DEFENDERS v DATA INTRUDERS (III)

PERFECT WAVE

TEAM: DIGITAL DEFENDERS
    
POWERS: He can navigate space, hyperspace and cyberspace on his board. The Perfect Wave does not require food or drink, he can survive by converting data into energy. He is almost totally indestrucible.

WEAPONS: His surfboard.

KRAZY KOOKIE

TEAM: DATA INTRUDERS

POWERS: He is always looking for a fight. He hates all Defenders but considers the Perfect Wave his worst enemy. He has a monstrous appetite for your secrets.

WEAPONS: His spinning robot arm.

» QUEST 4: SOME APPS ... 
[F] …are so secure that I never have to think about my privacy at all when using them.
[L] …are better than chocolate.
[O] …can access my contacts, pictures, and messages.




CHAPTER 8
Password security

Passwords. Very important in the digital age.

Incredibly important, in fact. They form the basis of your security and privacy. And most people's passwords are very, very weak – the most commonly used password
is »password» or »12345».

Creating a secure password is not very difficult.

1. Never use the same password twice

This is really one of the most important rules! At least, try to make different versions of the password you created.

Why? Because if criminals (like Data Smuggler) get access to the passwords of one service, they often try to enter other services with the same password. They
know that people tend to use the same password on several sites!

2. Never use a word from the dictionary

…no matter how long it may be or how complicated it may look.

Why? Because there are computer programmes that try every single word in the dictionary as a way of »guessing« your password. Every superhero in our Defenders team has a strong and creative password. You can join them – your password is your weapon to get out of danger!

3. Your password should be at least 12 characters long

This is the minimum. The longer a password is, the more difficult it is to hack it.

Why? Because the longer it is, the more difficult it is to guess. Some experts say that it is OK to write it down, just hide the piece of paper very well!

DIGITAL DEFENDERS v DATA INTRUDERS (IV)

QUEEN OF LOCKS

TEAM: DIGITAL DEFENDERS
    
POWERS: She fights for privacy and security. She gives powerful private keys to people who are in danger and helps them to secure their personal information online.

WEAPONS: Her helmet – she uses it to shoot energy beams from her eyes. She can cut right through Finn Phisher's dangerous net.

FINN PHISHER

TEAM: DATA INTRUDERS

POWERS: He possesses superhuman strength, speed and reflexes. He uses his powers to sneak into your phone and fish for your secrets.

WEAPONS: He throws an electrostatic data net to stun his opponents.

» QUEST 5: WHEN I BROWSE THE INTERNET...

[X] …I can do whatever I want, and I'm safe – it's not reality!
[U] …I can protect myself by not allowing cookies and not storing my browser history.
[Y] …being too careful is just paranoid, because I have nothing to hide.




CHAPTER 9
Photo and  video sharing

We tell our friends about our daily life by sharing images and videos with them online.

» Sharing is cool – but photos and videos can be copied easily.

Remember that it is always important to make sure that we are not sharing with people we don't want to share with. People might be able to see our private images, and misuse them.

What is the problem? If we send an image or video, we send a copy of it from our device to the device of a friend. Imagine that our friend shares the image again with others. Every copy can be copied again.

If we share a photo or video online, there will always be several copies of it on different devices. Even if we delete the original image from our own devices, the other copies will still be there.

When we share, our stuff can get into the hands of people that we didn't want to share with.

Some people could even try to steal our identity by using our images – just like I.D. Thief.

Snapchat is an app to share pictures that disappear quickly. Unfortunately, it is still possible to save a photo with a few tricks and share it again. Thousands of Snapchat images have already been put on the internet.

This means that we all have to live with the possibility that social networks can be used in good ways as well as bad ways. So we need to think before we post or send photos and videos via the internet! We should ask ourselves if we would put this photo on the public board of our school. If not, it's maybe not a good idea to share it online.

If our photo shows other people, we have to ask for their permission before sharing, because it is their right to decide.

For images that we did not take ourselves, we should ask the owner for permission before we share them online.

CHAPTER 11
Hands-on guide for Signal

Signal is a free Android and iPhone app. It doesn't watch what we say or who we talk to. We can use it to text, call, and share pictures, videos, and contacts.

It is not the only app we can use to communicate safely, but it is one of the easiest to use. Here is a handson-guide for it in five simple steps:
    
1. Go into the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iPhone). Search for »Signal«. Select the app »Signal Private Messenger« and tap ›Install‹. After Signal is installed, open the app.

2. Register your phone number with Signal by entering your mobile phone number and selecting ›Register‹ or ›Verify your device‹. You'll get a text message with a six digit code. Put that code into Signal.

3. Tap the pencil on the bottom right (Android) or the »+« symbol on the top right (iPhone) to start a conversation.

4. Select the person you want to text or call.

5. If you want to change between secure messages via your internet connection and insecure SMS, just hold the »Send« button for a tiny bit longer.

It's much more secure when the person who we're contacting is using Signal too. It uses our internet connection when we contact another Signal user and normal SMS or minutes when we contact someone who is not using Signal.

Remember! You don't have to get everyone you know to use Signal. Just tell your closest friends and the people you contact most often to install it too and then more and more of our friends will start using it.
